# Settings

Two hand-authored, checked-in config files that the `wetrecomp` binary loads
automatically at startup, plus a downloaded controller mapping database and
this README.

| File | Covers |
|---|---|
| [`hardware.toml`](hardware.toml) | Renderer/backend, window, vsync, resolution, debug output, experimental gameplay patches |
| [`mapping.toml`](mapping.toml) | Input backend selection (gamepad/keyboard+mouse) |
| [`gamecontrollerdb.txt`](gamecontrollerdb.txt) | SDL gamepad mappings for controllers it doesn't already recognize - not hand-authored, see below |

Split in two on purpose: rendering/perf tweaks and input tweaks are separate
concerns you'll want to touch independently (SOLID/DRY - one file per
concern instead of one growing junk-drawer file), and both stay tiny because
they only list the cvars this project actually cares about, not the full
~80-flag surface the SDK exposes (YAGNI).

**Format: flat `key = value` only, no `[Table]` headers.** Confirmed via
`rex::cvar::SerializeToTOML()`, which itself dumps a flat list - the loader
reads root-level keys, it does not recurse into nested tables. A key put
under a `[Section]` header is silently ignored (found the hard way: values
under `[Display]`/`[GPU]` headers never took effect until the headers were
removed).

## How the binary consumes them

`ReXApp` (the SDK base class) already auto-loads a single `<exe_dir>/<name>.toml`
config file via `rex::cvar::LoadConfig()`. `WetrecompApp::OnConfigurePaths()`
in [`src/wetrecomp_app.h`](../src/wetrecomp_app.h) redirects that single slot
to `settings/hardware.toml`, then loads both files a **second time** in
`OnPostSetup()`. Both paths are resolved by walking up from the exe's folder
until `wetrecomp_manifest.toml` is found, so it works from any build preset's
output directory without a hardcoded `../../../`.

The second pass exists because not every cvar is registered when
`OnConfigurePaths` runs: window/fullscreen/resolution/monitor (`rex::ui`)
are available immediately, but GPU-backend cvars like `vsync`,
`resolution_scale`, `d3d12_debug` (`rex::graphics`) only register once the
runtime/GPU backend spins up, which happens later. `LoadConfig()` is a
one-shot read, not a live watch, so without the second pass those keys would
be silently dropped (confirmed via `rex::cvar::GetFlagSource()` returning
`kDefault` for them after the first pass, `kConfig` after the second).
Re-applying an already-set value on the second pass is a harmless no-op.

## Why `game_data_root` isn't a key in `hardware.toml`

Unlike every other cvar here, `game_data_root` is read by the SDK (`ReXApp::
SetupEnvironment()`) *before* any config file loads at all - so a
`game_data_root = "..."` line in `hardware.toml` would silently have no
effect, the same one-shot-too-early problem as the two-pass cvars above but
with no later pass to catch it. Instead, `OnConfigurePaths()` defaults
`paths.game_data_root` directly to `<repo_root>/assets` in code whenever
`--game_data_root`/`REX_GAME_DATA_ROOT` didn't already set it, so
`wetrecomp.exe` with no flags at all just works from this repo layout.
`--game_data_root <path>` still overrides it for a game dump kept elsewhere.

Precedence (highest wins), same as any other cvar:

```
--flag=value (CLI)  >  REX_FLAG=value (env var)  >  settings/*.toml  >  compiled-in default
```

So a `--vsync=false` on the command line, or `REX_VSYNC=false` in the
environment, always overrides whatever is in `hardware.toml`.

## Caveat: the in-game Settings overlay writes to `hardware.toml`

The SDK's built-in Settings overlay's "Save to config" button writes *every*
modified cvar into the one path `OnConfigurePaths` redirected
(`hardware.toml`), including anything you changed at runtime through the
overlay. If you experiment there, expect `git diff` to show more than the
hand-picked keys below - `git checkout -- settings/hardware.toml` reverts it
to the committed defaults.

## Caveat: engine hotkeys aren't in `mapping.toml`

`mapping.toml` only covers static-flag input cvars (table below). The
console/debug/achievements overlay toggle keys ("Keybinds" category) are
registered by the SDK *after* these files load (once the window and
overlays exist), so a key added to `mapping.toml` for one of those would
silently have no effect. Rebind those from the in-game Settings overlay
instead - that persists through the same save mechanism described above.

## Keyboard, mouse, and gamepad all work at once

The SDK always merges every input device assigned to a guest player rather
than picking one active source (`rex::input::MergeInto` - buttons OR'd,
sticks/triggers take whichever device pushed further), and the keyboard as a
gamepad ("MnK") driver marks itself a synthetic device that's always folded
into player one alongside any physical pad, never competing with it for a
slot. So there's no "backend" to choose between keyboard and gamepad the way
`input_backend` chooses between `sdl`/`xinput` - it's `mnk_mode`/`mnk_mouse`
turning the keyboard/mouse side on or off, independent of whatever pad is
also plugged in.

Per-action keybinds (`keybind_a`, `keybind_lstick_up`, ...) already ship with
sensible WASD-style defaults and aren't repeated in `mapping.toml` (YAGNI) -
add any of them the same way as everything else here if you want to rebind
one. The full list isn't in the headers vendored under `rexglue/win-amd64`
(source-only, defined in the SDK's `mnk_input_driver.cpp`) - the easiest way
to see every current default is `rex::cvar::SerializeToTOML()`'s dump, or the
in-game Settings overlay's control rebinding screen.

## `hardware.toml` reference

| Key | Type | Default | Effect |
|---|---|---|---|
| `gpu_plugin` | string | `"xenos"` | GPU emulation plugin to load. Set here rather than on the command line now - see root [README](../README.md#run). A `--gpu_plugin` flag would still override this file if you ever needed a different plugin. |
| `graphics_backend` | string | `"any"` | Graphics API backend: `"any"` (D3D12 first when both are compiled in), `"d3d12"`, or `"vulkan"`. Project-defined cvar (not from the SDK), wired up in `OnPreSetup()` in [`src/wetrecomp_app.h`](../src/wetrecomp_app.h) - it loads the plugin itself with the requested backend before the SDK's own auto-load (which only ever requests `"any"`) runs. Falls back to automatic selection with a warning if the requested backend isn't compiled into `rexgpu-xenos`. |
| `vsync` | bool | `true` | Vertical sync. |
| `resolution_scale` | int | `1` | Internal render-target supersampling, independent of window/guest resolution. |
| `async_shader_compilation` | bool | `true` | Compile shaders on a background thread instead of blocking the render thread - reduces hitches when new shaders are first seen. |
| `native_2x_msaa` | bool | `false` | Native 2x MSAA on the emulated render targets. |
| `anisotropic_override` | int | `0` | Forces anisotropic texture filtering to this level (e.g. `16`); `0` leaves the game's own setting alone. |
| `window_width` / `window_height` | int | `1280` / `720` | Host window size. |
| `fullscreen` | bool | `false` | Host window fullscreen. |
| `monitor` | int | `0` | Host monitor index for fullscreen. |
| `resolution` | string | `"1280x720"` | Guest ("TV") video mode reported to the game - affects the game's own UI scale/aspect logic, separate from the host window size above. |
| `present_letterbox` | bool | `true` | Letterbox instead of stretch when window and guest aspect ratios differ. |
| `d3d12_debug` | bool | `false` | D3D12 debug layer. Leave off - noticeably slower. |
| `wet_fps60_unlock` | bool | `false` | Experimental. Ported from the community xenia-canary `game-patches` "60 FPS" patch for WET (title `425307DB`). Project-defined cvar, patched directly into `sub_83066D80` in [`generated/default/wetrecomp_recomp.218.cpp`](../generated/default/wetrecomp_recomp.218.cpp) (a frame-timing divisor), gated behind this cvar instead of always-on since it can affect physics/animation tuned for the original update rate. Off by default, matching upstream. |

## `mapping.toml` reference

| Key | Type | Default | Effect |
|---|---|---|---|
| `input_backend` | string | `"sdl"` | `""` is rejected by validation (logs a warning, falls back to default) - must be an explicit `"sdl"` or `"xinput"`. |
| `hid_mappings_file` | string | `"gamecontrollerdb.txt"` | Extra SDL gamepad mappings loaded for controllers SDL doesn't already recognize, or `""` to skip. `gamecontrollerdb.txt` next to the exe is staged by `CMakeLists.txt` from [`gamecontrollerdb.txt`](gamecontrollerdb.txt) in this folder, sourced from [mdqinc/SDL_GameControllerDB](https://github.com/mdqinc/SDL_GameControllerDB) - re-copy that file from upstream any time to refresh it. |
| `guide_button` | bool | `true` | Whether the controller Guide/PS button is routed to the guest. |
| `mnk_mode` | bool | `true` | Enables keyboard-as-controller input, merged in alongside any physical gamepad (see below). |
| `mnk_mouse` | bool | `true` | Routes mouse movement to the right stick when `mnk_mode` is on. Off means the right stick only comes from the `keybind_rstick_*` keys. |
| `mnk_sensitivity` | double | `1.0` | Mouse sensitivity for the right stick, range `0.01`-`10.0`. |

Gamepad button layout itself (DualShock 4, DualSense, Xbox, Switch Pro, ...)
isn't a setting here - SDL auto-detects the controller and maps it to the
Xbox 360 layout the game expects.

## Adding more cvars

Any cvar declared with `REXCVAR_DECLARE` under
`rexglue/win-amd64/include/rex/**/flags.h` can be added the same way: pick
the file matching its concern (hardware vs. input), add `key = value`. If it
needs to apply before the window/overlays exist (true for everything
currently listed), it belongs in one of these two files loaded from
`OnConfigurePaths`; if it's a Keybinds-category hotkey, see the caveat above
instead.

`graphics_backend` and `wet_fps60_unlock` aren't SDK cvars - they're defined
with `REXCVAR_DEFINE_STRING`/`REXCVAR_DEFINE_BOOL` directly in
[`src/wetrecomp_app.h`](../src/wetrecomp_app.h), registering at static-init
time just like the SDK's own, so they load fine on the first pass. This is
the pattern to follow for any other project-specific toggle (e.g. a future
ported patch): declare it next to `WetrecompApp`, read it with
`REXCVAR_GET(name)` wherever it's needed, and document it in this table.
